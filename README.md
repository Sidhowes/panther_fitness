### Typogaphy
For this website I used fonts from Google fonts as they are easy to use and import into the css folder.
I used Roboto sans-serif.

### Defensive Design
* All forms cannot be left empty and must be filled out.
* Forms give feedback if a option is left blank or the right syntax is not used.

## Deployment

For this project we used Heroku to deploy the app. We also used AWS as a databse holder for static and media files and then Gitpod as our IDE.

#### Heroku

Firstly we need to set up files that Heroku needs to run the app.

These are the applications and dependencies to run the app.
```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
Next the Procfile is what heroku looks for to know which file runs the app and how to run it.
```
echo web: python app.py > Procfile
```

Once the files have been created. Log on or create an account with Heroku and create an app.
* The app name must be unique with no spaces and in lower case.
* Link that app to the GitHub repository by going to the "Deployment method".
* Once linked scroll down to "Connect to Github" and add your repository name and click search and then connect.
* In the Settings tab, add the corresponding Config Variables as present in local development:
```
DATABASE_URL postgress://...
SECRET_KEY FJHFJD7474...
```
* Now that the config variables are inserted but before deployment you must go back and git push the Procfile and Requirements.txt
to github.
```
git add -A
```
```
git commit -m "Add Procfile and requirements.txt"
```
```
git push
```

* Next enable deployment on heroku
* Deploy master branch
* Now that we have Deployed Branch Heroku will start buliding the app which takes 2 minute.
* Once bulit it will have a message "Your app was successfully deployed."
* Click view underneath the message to launch the app.
* The app is now deployed on heroku and whenever you push changes to github it will also be linked to the heroku app.

#### AWS

AWS amazon account was created for holding media and static files and will need to create a s3 bucket to put them in - [AWS - S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)
